# RedditFilterExtension
* My first Chrome extension app. It's used to filter my Reddit feeds.

## Purpose of Extension:
* It blocks Reddit posts by phrases, order matters.
    * I made this to block out meme posts like: 
        * "say something nice about ..."
        * "When you ..."
        * "That feeling when ..."
    * People typically have similar patterns of speech online so this app deal with that.

## How To Use It:
* Download the zip
    * extract
    * Load unpacked in Developer mode at chrome://extensions/
    * Add to extension bar
    * type in phrase, hit add, add more if you want, add, then save. Boom no more annoying posts
* The extension is case insensitive. It should work as soon as you hit save, if not reload page.
